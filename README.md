# Luxury Journal

A KDE Plasma 6 dashboard theme — leather-bound journal aesthetic, applied
system-wide through one color scheme, nine fonts, and six custom plasmoids.

## What's inside

Three moving pieces — all the rest is Plasma itself:

1. **`luxury-journal.colors`** — a Plasma 6 color scheme (parchment, ink,
   burgundy). Applies system-wide; built-in and third-party widgets
   inherit the palette automatically.
2. **Nine fonts** installed user-local: Parisienne, Caveat, Cormorant
   Garamond (Light / Regular / Medium / SemiBold), Cormorant SC, IM FELL
   DW Pica, JetBrains Mono.
3. **Eleven custom plasmoids**, all self-contained after install:
   - **Luxury Greeting** — cursive greeting that rotates with the day and
     the week, with a Parisienne drop-cap that gently breathes.
   - **Tmux Tail** — the last N lines of a tmux pane, refreshed on a
     timer. Double-click to attach.
   - **Journal Tasks** — reads `~/notes/tasks.md`, parses `## headers`
     and `- [ ]` checkboxes, click to toggle, inline add-entry field.
   - **Journal Clock** — serif digital time with a moon-phase glyph.
   - **Journal Weather** — OpenMeteo (no API key), three lines of journal
     prose.
   - **Journal NowPlaying** — MPRIS via qdbus, hover for ◁◁ ❙❙ ▷▷ controls.
   - **System Info** — compact 3×3 donut-gauge grid: CPU%, CPU temp,
     memory, GPU%, GPU temp, disk, battery, network, ping. Unavailable
     metrics show as dimmed "—" tiles.
   - **Analog Clock** — a clock face housed in a wax seal (burgundy disc
     with gilt Roman numerals) or a postage stamp (perforated, with a
     postmark), switchable from config.
   - **Almanac** — ordinal date, season, moon phase, day-of-year,
     countdown to a configured event. No network.
   - **Commonplace Book** — a rotating quote with attribution. 20
     built-in classical quotes; an optional `~/notes/quotes.txt` overrides
     them (`quote | attribution` lines).
   - **Hourglass** — Pomodoro count-down drawn as an hourglass with
     gilt sand draining between bulbs. Optional command on completion.

   Every plasmoid has per-instance **background opacity** (10–100%) and
   an **edge style** (rounded, ripped paper, deckle, postage-stamp
   perforations, embossed) under the wrench icon.

## Install

```bash
git clone <this-repo> luxury-journal
cd luxury-journal
./install.sh
```

Then: System Settings → Colors & Themes → pick "Luxury Journal"; right-click
desktop → Add or Manage Widgets → add whichever of the six you want.

Flags:
- `./install.sh --dry-run` — preview actions, no writes
- `./install.sh --no-fonts` — skip font downloads
- `./install.sh --force` — overwrite the color scheme even if modified

## Uninstall

```bash
./uninstall.sh           # removes plasmoids + color scheme; keeps fonts
./uninstall.sh --purge   # also removes fonts
```

## Develop

```bash
./dev.sh preview tmuxtail     # live preview a plasmoid
./dev.sh reload  tmuxtail     # copy shared QML + kpackagetool6 --upgrade
```

Short names (`tmuxtail`, `journaltasks`, `journalclock`, …) and full names
(`com.utku.tmuxtail`, …) both work.

## Companion widgets from the KDE Store

The project pairs well with these built-ins, which inherit the color scheme
automatically:

- **System Monitor** — pages for machine (CPU/RAM/GPU/disk/battery) and
  network (wi-fi SSID, bandwidth, ping).
- **Weather Report** (if you want more than the journal-prose version).
- **Notes** — the sticky-note for a scratchpad.
- **Folder View** or **Quicklaunch** — the "at hand" icon grid.

## Troubleshooting

**Fonts don't render.** Check `fc-list | grep -i parisienne`. If empty,
re-run `./install.sh` (or `fc-cache -f ~/.local/share/fonts/luxury-journal`).

**Plasmoid shows QML errors.** Tail `journalctl --user -f -t plasmashell`
while the widget is being reloaded. Most errors at install time are
missing-import errors; confirm `install.sh` copied `shared/qml/*` into the
plasmoid's `contents/ui/shared/`.

**Tmux Tail says "session not found".** Verify
`tmux list-sessions` shows the configured target. The value is
`session[:window[.pane]]`, default `research:0`.

**Weather widget silent.** Check that `curl` can reach
`https://api.open-meteo.com`. Verify the configured city name resolves
via `curl -sS 'https://geocoding-api.open-meteo.com/v1/search?name=<city>&count=1'`.

**NowPlaying widget empty.** Run `qdbus | grep MediaPlayer2` — if nothing
listed, no player is exposing MPRIS. Spotify (native), mpv with the
`mpv-mpris` script, Firefox, and Chromium all work out of the box.
